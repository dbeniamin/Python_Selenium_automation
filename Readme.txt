This project is dedicated to learning selenium and practice to write test script using

https://the-internet.herokuapp.com

The goal is to cover all the section and maybe make a big script at the end that contains all the tests.
All the files in this section will contain some explanations and personal notes.
I do research along the way, so some comments might not be very professional, but I believe taking notes helps along the way.

Update: I already hit the block that drag and drop is not working.

Update_1: Drag and Drop fixed with what was classified as ingenious by a much more experience QA engineer. 
New file attached: drag_and_drop_pyautogui.py

Update_2 - Added unit test to the testing scripts.
