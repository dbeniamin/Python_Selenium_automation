# SELENIUM Automation with Python for https://the-internet.herokuapp.com

This project showcases Selenium automation testing for various functionalities provided by [the-internet.herokuapp.com](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com). It includes test cases with a normal structure and unittest-based structure.


### Introduction:

In the world of web development and software testing, automated testing is an integral part of ensuring the reliability and functionality of applications. This project focuses on automating tests for [the-internet.herokuapp.com](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com), a platform designed for practicing and showcasing different web elements and scenarios.

### Key Features:

- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Verify that your web application works seamlessly across different browsers.
- **Element Interaction:** Learn how to interact with various HTML elements using Selenium WebDriver.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Understand and implement the Page Object Model for better test structure and maintainability.
- **Unittest Framework:** Explore test case organization using the unittest framework in Python.

### Project Structure:

### tests: This folder contains all the Selenium test cases.
- **normal_structure:** Test cases organized in a normal structure and have the name of tested feature.
- **unittest_structure:** Test cases organized using the unittest framework and have the name of tested feature alongside a _unittest mention.

### Requirements:

- unittest
- selenium
- requests
- urllib3
- pyautogui

### Installation:

1. **Fork this repository:**
   
   Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy of these Selenium automation scripts.

2. **Clone your forked repository:**

   Copy and run the desired scripts.

### Usage:


### Normal Structure Scripts

To use the scripts with a normal structure:

1. Copy the content of scriptname.py .
2. Paste the content into a new Python file (e.g., `my_dropdown_script.py`).
3. Save the file and run it.

Feel free to modify and adapt the script based on your specific requirements.

### Unittest Script

To use the scripts with a unittest structure:

1. Copy the content of scriptname_unittest.py .
2. Paste the content into a new Python file (e.g., `my_dropdown_unittest_script.py`).
3. Save the file and run.

You can customize the scripts as needed for your own testing scenarios. Additionally, ensure you have the required dependencies installed as mentioned in the Requirements section.

Feel free to explore the scripts in the repository and adapt them to suit your automation needs.

### Description:

**Normal Scripts** : open the target page, locate the element or elements and interact with it so the user can see the action and the result.

**Unittest Scripts** : open the target page, locate the element or elements and interact with it so the user can see the action and the result. This approach focuses on creating test classes that can be reused or grouped with a test runner and method passing approach.
